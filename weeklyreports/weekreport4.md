### What is the right to repair movement and why does it matter?

The right to repair is a movement urging tech companies to allow access to schematics and original parts of one's device in order for them to be able to repair their devices themselves or through a 3rd party service provider. This movement means a lot to consumers as they face systematic and other types of failures with their devices/equipment that cannot be repaired directly by the tech company due to availability and flexibility issues but the consumer need their devices running again soon.
