 **Sudo** allows the run of any command as root user, **Apt** is a program that I use to manage the software and updates, **Update** allows the download of package information from all configured sources, using **";"** you can run multiple commands in a single line, and the **"-y"** serves as the confirmation to a command, it is optional but once 100% sure about an upgrade it is usable.
