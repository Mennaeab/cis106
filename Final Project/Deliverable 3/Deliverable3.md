### Programing

For many reasons, Ubuntu is the finest Linux distribution for developers. The first reason is that several developing technologies such as deep learning, artificial intelligence, and machine learning are supported. Microsoft, Google, and Amazon have all made significant investments in deep learning. The IT companies are investing in the development of dedicated deep learning tools. Because of the numerous libraries, examples, and tutorials, Ubuntu is the finest OS for developers. Unlike any other OS, Ubuntu's features greatly aid AI, machine learning, and deep learning. Ubuntu also offers enough compatibility for the most recent versions of free open source software and platforms. As a result, many well-known frameworks, including as Keras, OpenCV, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Theano, choose Ubuntu. Another reason to think of Ubuntu as the finest operating system for programming is its AI support. Many recent changes in the AI scene can be attributed to GPUs. NVIDIA's current expenditures in CUDA on Linux are aimed at maximizing the capabilities of their latest graphics hardware. You may now use traditional PCI slots on motherboards or external Thunderbolt adapters to add graphics cards to Ubuntu.

### How to get help with your Ubuntu machine
Sometimes the new environment in an operating system is user-friendly, and we have no trouble interacting with it. However, there are occasions when the new environment is so intricate and odd that we are entirely lost. In this case, we require guidance or assistance from the new environment to help us achieve our objectives. Almost every piece of software or operating system we come across has some type of built-in assistance to assist novice and inexperienced users. When it comes to the Ubuntu terminal or command line interface, there are various ways to seek support.

**The ways to get help from Ubuntu terminal or Command line:**

1. Use the command options –h or –help
2. Use tab completion on the Shell
3. Use the info command *example: `info bash`*
