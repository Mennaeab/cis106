## Question 5
 **I like the idea of how simplistic [DahliaOs](https://dahliaos.io/#features) It allows you to use the containers app to combine your favorite apps even those from other operating systems together in one place, The operating system also allows you to use it on those older as well new supporting hardware. A few of the features that I like are Internet recovery; it allows you to get your work back at any malfunction while operating. Its a free and open source allowing use with all the source codes to be found on the github platform and lastly that it is developer friendly allowing you to run your favorite development softwares.**
